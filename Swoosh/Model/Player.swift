// Use a struct whenever you can - i.e. when using primitive types, etc. Struct is a value type and can be copied over directly. Whereas a class is an object and can be referenced but not copied easily. Structs are also faster.


struct Player {
    var desiredLeague: String!
    var selectedSkillLevel: String!
    
}
